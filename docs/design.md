## Egyptian Astrology App — Design & Color Specification

Read this file before writing any UI code, choosing any color value,
or making any layout decision.

The short version of everything in this file: every color maps to a
real historical Egyptian pigment; gold means divinity and nothing else;
the app feels like the inside of a tomb, not the outside of a planetarium.

EGYPTIAN ASTROLOGY APP — DESIGN & COLOR SPECIFICATION FOR CLAUDE CODE
======================================================================

This file governs all visual and design decisions for the app. Read it
before writing any UI code, choosing any color value, or making any
layout decision. Every color in this spec maps to a real historical
Egyptian pigment. That is not trivia — it is the reason the palette
feels coherent and premium rather than themed or costumed.

Reference files:
- egyptian_astrology_engine.md (v1.3) — reading engine and content
- feature_plan_for_claude_code.txt — full feature list by version
- This file — all design decisions


==============================================================================
THE ONE RULE THAT GOVERNS ALL COLOR DECISIONS
==============================================================================

Gold is never decorative. In Egyptian art, gold indicated the flesh of
the gods — divinity made visible. In this app, gold text and gold accents
mean something carries divine authority: an active decan name, a natal
placement, a hemerological charge, the name of a presiding deity.
Everything else — supporting text, dates, metadata, secondary labels —
uses sand, papyrus, or ochre tones.

If you are deciding whether to use gold on something, ask: is this
decreed? Is this the divine record speaking? If yes, gold. If it is
context, support, or navigation, it is not gold.

This hierarchy is the mythology made visible. Hold it consistently.


==============================================================================
THE FOUR COLOR SCHEMES
==============================================================================

The four schemes are not competing options. They are a single coherent
system where each scheme serves a specific context. Default dark for
readings, light for editorial content, high-contrast for sacred caution
days, seasonal tints as overlays.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEME 1: DUAT NIGHT (default — dark mode)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary scheme. Used for: main reading screens, daily feed, sky map,
Oracle Chamber, Ka Reading, Circle of Ka, all core app navigation.
Most users will experience this scheme most of the time.

Inspired by: the interior of a royal tomb — lapis lazuli walls, gold
leaf hieroglyphs, faience amulets catching lamplight. Rich, contained,
alive with precise detail. Not oppressive dark — deep and deliberate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEME 2: AKHET DAWN (light mode — Temple Library and editorial)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Used for: Temple Library (deity glossary, sacred calendar, Cosmic Climate
editorial content). Switched to automatically when the user enters the
Temple Library. Also available as a user preference for the full app.

Inspired by: a freshly plastered tomb wall in morning light. The actual
color of Egyptian plaster is warm white, not cold white. Warm, material,
ancient but breathable.

Colors:

  GYPSUM (page background)          #F7F0E3
  SAND LIGHT (card / surface)       #EDE3D0

  Inactive navigation:              GOLD DARK #8B6914
  Active / highlighted badge:       MALACHITE #1B6B68
  Borders, dividers:                rgba(0,0,0,0.06)
  Card bottom bar:                  SAND MID #D9CEBA


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEME 3: BLACK LAND (contextual — sacred caution days only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL: This scheme is never the default. It activates automatically
on specific hemerological dates only. It must never appear on ordinary
days. Its power comes entirely from its rarity.

Activates on these dates (from engine Section 11.6.1):
  - July 20: Birth of Set
  - October 7: Death of Osiris
  - Eclipse day readings (solar and lunar)
  - Any day the engine flags as inauspicious in the hemerological table

When active: the reading card switches to this scheme. The rest of the
app UI remains in Duat Night. Only the reading card and its push
notification use Black Land colors. The transition should be immediate
and noticeable — no gradual fade.

Inspired by: carbon black pigment (the actual Egyptian black, made from
charcoal) with red ochre. The color of inauspicious days in the real
hemerological papyri was red — scribes literally wrote in red ink on
bad days.

Colors:

  VOID BLACK (deepest background)   #0A0A0A
  CHAR (card background)            #141010
  EMBER (elevated surface)          #1E1410
  BLOOD (dark red accent)           #8B2010
  OCHRE RED (primary red)           #C4481A
  FIRE RED (highlight red)          #E06030
  GOLD (divine decree)              #D4AF37
  BRIGHT GOLD (emphasis)            #F0D060
  PAPYRUS (text)                    #E8E0CC
  ASH (secondary text)              #888070

Usage rules for Black Land:

  Card background:                  CHAR #141010
  Card left border accent:          3px solid OCHRE RED #C4481A
  Card elevated bar:                EMBER #1E1410
  Decan / day label:                FIRE RED #E06030
  Primary reading text:             PAPYRUS #E8E0CC
  Witnessing close text:            ASH #888070
  Sacred caution badge:             OCHRE RED #C4481A
  Date text:                        ASH #888070
  Card border:                      rgba(196,72,26,0.3)
  Push icon background:             BLOOD #8B2010
  Push title:                       OCHRE RED #C4481A or BRIGHT GOLD #F0D060


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEME 4: SEASONAL TINTS (overlays on Duat Night)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applied as a subtle background tint on season-specific content. Not a
full mode switch — a color temperature shift that overlays the standard
Duat Night scheme. Applied to: the Sothis annual reading card, natal
season descriptions, the hemerological calendar season view, and seasonal
decan readings.

Tints are applied as a semi-transparent overlay on LAPIS #141828
cards — do not replace the card background, layer over it at 20-30%
opacity.

AKHET (Inundation — Cancer through Libra):
  Tint color:   #1A3A5C (deep Nile blue)
  Text accent:  #5EC8C4 (turquoise)
  Label:        "Akhet · The Inundation"
  Character:    Deep, boundary-dissolving, the gods are close

PERET (Growing season — Scorpio through Aquarius):
  Tint color:   #2A3A1A (malachite green)
  Text accent:  #7ABB50 (growth green)
  Label:        "Peret · The Growing Season"
  Character:    Deliberate, cultivating, seeds becoming form

SHEMU (Harvest — Pisces through Gemini):
  Tint color:   #3A2A10 (amber gold)
  Text accent:  #D4AF37 (harvest gold)
  Label:        "Shemu · The Harvest"
  Character:    Completion, reckoning, the anticipation of Sothis


==============================================================================
TYPOGRAPHY
==============================================================================

Font stack:

  Primary (headings, deity names, decan titles):
    Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif
    Used for: all names with divine authority, section headings,
    reading openings. Georgia has the weight and warmth of carved
    stone without feeling archaic.

  Body (reading text, descriptions, UI labels):
    System sans-serif stack: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,
    "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif
    Used for: all reading prose, dates, metadata, navigation labels.
    Needs to be highly readable at small sizes on mobile.

  Monospace (hieroglyphic symbols only):
    Used sparingly for Egyptian Unicode characters (𓂀 𓅓 𓇋 𓆣 etc.)
    when displayed as decorative glyphs. Not for body text.

Sizing scale (mobile-first):

  Decan / day label (small caps feel):  11px, letter-spacing 0.10em,
                                         font-weight 500, serif
  Secondary text / metadata:            12px, font-weight 400, sans
  Push body / card date:                12px, font-weight 400, sans
  Push title:                           13px, font-weight 500, sans
  Body reading text:                    14px, font-weight 400, sans,
                                         line-height 1.65
  Witnessing close:                     13px, font-weight 400, sans,
                                         line-height 1.65, secondary color
  Card / screen headings:               17px, font-weight 500, serif
  Section headings:                     20px, font-weight 500, serif
  Screen title:                         22px, font-weight 500, serif

Rules:
  - Never use font-weight 700 or bold in the reading text. The priestly
    voice is authority through certainty, not through emphasis.
  - Deity names and decan titles in the reading body should be in serif
    and in gold — not bold, just differentiated by font and color.
  - Line height for all reading prose: 1.65. The text needs room to
    breathe. Reading on a phone is intimate — do not crowd it.
  - Letter spacing on small decan labels: 0.10em. This creates the
    feeling of an inscription without requiring actual hieroglyphs.


==============================================================================
LAYOUT AND SPACING
==============================================================================

Card structure (the primary reading surface):

  Border radius:          16px (cards feel tactile, not sharp)
  Padding inside:         20px horizontal, 20px vertical
  Card top section:       reading content
  Card bottom bar:        date + status badge, slightly darker background,
                          separated by a 1px border at rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
  Card shadow:            none — depth comes from color contrast, not shadow
  Card border:            1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06) in dark mode
                          1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06) in light mode

Bottom navigation:

  5 items: Today / Chart / Ka / Temple / Oracle
  Height: 56px
  Active item: accent color (Faience in dark, Gold in light) +
               2px bottom border in accent color
  Inactive items: SAND #A0967A
  Background: matches scheme surface color (LAPIS or GYPSUM)
  No icons in v1 — text labels only (this is a reading app, not
  a utility app; icon-only navigation is too ambiguous here)
  Top border: 1px at rgba(255,255,255,0.06) in dark mode

Screen padding:

  Horizontal page margin:     20px each side
  Content max-width:          400px, centered on larger screens
  Space between cards:        16px
  Space between sections:     32px
  Space above screen title:   48px (leaves room for status bar)


==============================================================================
THE SKY MAP (Egyptian birth chart visual)
==============================================================================

The sky map is the most design-intensive screen in the app. It is NOT
a Western zodiac wheel. The following describes its required visual
structure.

Overall shape: circular, centered on screen.

Visual layers from outside to inside:
  1. Outer ring: the 36 decans — small segments, each tappable,
     labeled with decan number (1–36). Active natal decans
     highlighted in GOLD LEAF #D4AF37. Others in SAND #A0967A.

  2. Middle ring: the 12 zodiac signs — wider segments with sign
     glyphs or abbreviated names. Each sign contains 3 decan segments
     from the outer ring.

  3. Inner ring: the 12 houses — labeled with their Egyptian names
     (the Akhet, the Granary, etc.) in small serif text.

  4. Center field: the Nut figure — a simplified line illustration of
     the sky goddess arching across the circle. Stars as small dots
     in PAPYRUS #E8E0CC at 15-20% opacity, scattered in the center.
     This is decorative but must be present — it is the mythological
     container of the chart.

  5. Planetary glyphs: planets placed at their natal degree positions
     as small Egyptian deity symbols (custom glyphs, not Western
     planet symbols). Each glyph in GOLD LEAF or TURQUOISE depending
     on whether it is a natal position or a current transit.

Bottom element: the Nile — a thin sinuous horizontal line in
FAIENCE #2AADAA at the base of the circle, below the chart,
representing the earthly ground beneath the sky. Purely visual,
not functional.

Tapping behavior: tapping any decan, house, or planetary glyph opens
a bottom sheet with the relevant Temple Library entry. The bottom
sheet uses the standard card surface color and slides up over the
chart. Tapping outside dismisses it.

Color in the sky map:
  Chart circle background:        LAPIS #141828 (same as card surface)
  Outer ring (decans) fill:       VOID #0D0E1A
  Decan segment borders:          SAND #A0967A at 20% opacity
  Active (natal) decan:           GOLD LEAF #D4AF37 fill
  Active (natal) planet glyph:    GOLD LEAF #D4AF37
  Current transit glyph:          TURQUOISE #5EC8C4
  House divider lines:            SAND #A0967A at 15% opacity
  House labels:                   SAND #A0967A, 10px serif
  Nut illustration lines:         PAPYRUS #E8E0CC at 20% opacity
  Nile line:                      FAIENCE #2AADAA at 40% opacity


==============================================================================
STATUS BADGES AND LABELS
==============================================================================

Transit badges (shown on reading card bottom bar):

  Active natal decan:   gold dot + "Natal decan" in GOLD LEAF
  Active transit:       gold dot + "Active transit" in GOLD LEAF
  Sothis decan:         turquoise dot + "Sothis decan" in TURQUOISE
  Retrograde active:    sand dot + "Thoth withdrawn" or "[Planet] Rx"
                        in SAND — retrogrades are not alarming
  Sacred caution:       red dot + "Sacred caution" in OCHRE RED
                        (only on hemerological inauspicious days)
  Eclipse active:       red dot + "Apep strikes" in OCHRE RED

Dot size: 6px diameter, border-radius 50%.
Badge text: 11px, font-weight 500, letter-spacing 0.03em.
Badge layout: dot + text, aligned center, right-justified in card
bottom bar.


==============================================================================
ICONOGRAPHY AND GLYPHS
==============================================================================

Egyptian Unicode characters available for use as decorative glyphs:

  𓂀  (Eye of Horus) — used as app icon/logo mark, section dividers
  𓅓  (Falcon) — Horus, Ra, sky, daily reading
  𓇋  (Reed) — Thoth, writing, Oracle Chamber
  𓆣  (Scarab) — Khepri, becoming, transformation
  𓏏  (Bread loaf) — offering, the giving force
  𓂋  (Arm) — action, reach, the practical call
  𓁹  (Eye) — seeing, awareness, the witnessing close
  𓇳  (Sun disk) — Ra, vital force, solar reading

These glyphs are used:
  - As section identifiers in the Temple Library
  - As small decorative elements in reading cards (leading the decan
    label line)
  - As the app icon base (Eye of Horus, stylized)

Rules:
  - Never use these glyphs as navigation icons — they are too
    ambiguous for functional UI
  - Always render in the same color as the text they accompany
  - Size: 14-16px when inline with text, 24-32px when decorative
  - Do not use more than one glyph per card surface


==============================================================================
ANIMATION AND MOTION
==============================================================================

Philosophy: the app should feel like stone and water, not glass and
chrome. Transitions are deliberate and unhurried. Nothing bounces.
Nothing springs. The pace is the pace of a temple interior.

Permitted transitions:

  Screen transitions:    fade, 280ms, ease-in-out
  Card appearance:       fade up from 8px below, 320ms, ease-out
  Bottom sheet entry:    slide up, 300ms, cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)
  Bottom sheet dismiss:  slide down, 240ms, ease-in
  Active state change:   color crossfade, 180ms, ease
  Badge pulse (eclipse): single slow pulse, 2s, ease-in-out, plays once

Forbidden:
  - Spring animations (no bouncing, no overshoot)
  - Parallax scrolling
  - Particle effects (no stars "falling" in the sky map)
  - Auto-playing loops on the main reading screen
  - Haptic feedback on reading delivery — reading arrival is silent

The sky map may rotate slowly and continuously (the diurnal cycle of
the heavens) at a rate of approximately one full rotation per 24 hours,
anchored to real sidereal time. This rotation is extremely subtle — the
user should feel the sky is alive, not that the screen is spinning.
Rotation speed: imperceptible in 30 seconds, visible over 5 minutes.
This is optional — implement only if performance allows without
battery impact.


==============================================================================
READING TEXT DISPLAY
==============================================================================

The reading is the product. How it is displayed matters as much as what
it says. These rules govern reading text rendering specifically.

  Display as flowing prose, no headers, no bullet points.
  Paragraph breaks: a full blank line between registers
    (decree, mirror, call, witnessing close).
  The witnessing close: rendered in SAND secondary color (not PAPYRUS
    primary), same size, no italic. Differentiated by color only —
    not by style or size. The shift in color is the only signal that
    this is a different register of voice.
  Deity names in the reading body: rendered in GOLD LEAF serif, not
    bold. The name of the active deity is the only thing in gold in
    the body text.
  Do not animate the text in (no typewriter effect, no character-by-
    character reveal). The reading appears fully formed, instantly.
    The priestly voice does not type. It decrees.
  Maximum width: 360px on mobile, centered. Reading text should never
    stretch full screen width — line length affects rhythm.

Push notification display:

  Icon: app icon (Eye of Horus) on ELECTRUM background
  Title: BRIGHT GOLD #F0D060, 13px, font-weight 500
  Body: SAND #A0967A, 12px, font-weight 400
  On sacred caution days: title in OCHRE RED #C4481A instead


==============================================================================
WHAT THIS APP SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE
==============================================================================

These are anti-patterns. If any screen is moving toward these, reconsider.

  NOT mystical purple / dark purple gradients:
    Purple is not Egyptian. It reads as generic "spiritual app" or
    generic "astrology app." Every competitor uses purple. We do not.

  NOT gold everything:
    Gold as a highlight means something. Gold on every surface means
    nothing. If gold is everywhere, the hierarchy collapses.

  NOT constellation backgrounds:
    A starfield background is the first thing every astrology app does.
    We do not. The sky is depicted in the sky map, which is functional.
    The reading card background is solid LAPIS — the inside of a tomb,
    not the outside of a planetarium.

  NOT rounded pill buttons in gold:
    Pill-shaped call-to-action buttons in gold look like a luxury
    skincare app. Primary actions should use text with the gold color,
    or a contained button with subtle border — not filled gold pills.

  NOT hieroglyphic borders everywhere:
    A single hieroglyphic glyph at the start of a section is powerful.
    A hieroglyphic border running around every card is a theme park.
    Restraint is the rule.

  NOT light teal or mint as the primary color:
    Turquoise/faience is an accent and an active state indicator.
    It is not the brand color. The brand color (if one must be named)
    is the dark lapis of Duat Night — deep, contained, deliberate.
