EGYPTIAN ASTROLOGY APP — FEATURE PLAN FOR CLAUDE CODE
=======================================================

Reference files:
- egyptian_astrology_engine.md (v1.3) — the AI reading engine, all logic lives here
- This file — product feature list by build version

The engine file is the authoritative source for all reading content, voice
rules, transit handling, hemerological calendar dates, and calculation logic.
Section 12 of the engine file contains Claude Code implementation instructions
including ephemeris setup, calculation requirements, request format, caching
strategy, and the full daily reading decision tree as pseudocode. Read Section
12 before writing any code.


==============================================================================
LAUNCH — Must ship on day one
==============================================================================

1. DAILY READING
   What it is: A personalized daily reading generated from the user's natal
   chart plus today's transit state.
   Two user-selectable depths set at onboarding:
   - The Decree: short form, 3-4 sentences
   - The Full Crossing: full four-register reading (180-250 words)
   How to build: Pass natal data + today's transit flags to Claude Sonnet via
   the Anthropic API using the engine file as system prompt. Transit detection
   logic (what flags to pass) is in engine Section 12.6. Reading request
   format is in engine Section 12.4. User depth preference stored in profile.
   Output is plain prose, no headers or bullet points.

2. PUSH NOTIFICATION
   What it is: One push notification per day, max 12 words, priestly voice.
   Tone calibrated to the day's charge — warm on light days, steady on dark.
   Priority logic: hemerological push overrides transit push on July 20
   (Set's birthday) and October 7 (Death of Osiris).
   How to build: Push priority order is in engine Section 12.7. Hemerological
   push copy is pre-written in engine Section 11.6.1 — no AI call needed for
   those. All other pushes generated via API. Send via FCM/APNs.

3. NATAL BIRTH READING
   What it is: A full birth reading generated once at onboarding from the
   user's date, time, and place of birth. 400-600 words. Covers: Ascendant
   decan (birth decree), Egyptian season, Sun decan (vital force), Moon decan
   (night current), 10th house force, Shai and Shepsut lot positions.
   How to build: Swiss Ephemeris calculates positions → decan lookups →
   engine generates natal reading. Cache all natal fields per user (full list
   in engine Section 12.5). Regenerate only if user corrects birth data.
   House system: Whole Sign exclusively (engine Section 12.2).

4. TRANSIT READINGS (woven into daily reading automatically)
   What it is: Retrogrades, eclipses, Saturn return, Jupiter return, Sothis
   annual reading, planetary stations — all integrated into the daily reading,
   not surfaced as separate alerts. The user does not need to know what is
   happening astronomically. The reading tells them through the mythology.
   How to build: Transit detection layer runs before every daily reading.
   Full decision tree pseudocode in engine Section 12.6. Each transit type
   has its mythological frame and reading template in engine Section 11.

5. HEMEROLOGICAL CALENDAR (daily layer)
   What it is: 17 charged dates per year from real Egyptian sources. Each
   date adds a hemerological line as the final sentence of that day's reading,
   and overrides the push notification on two specific dates.
   How to build: Static date lookup table — query by month/day on app open.
   Full table with exact Gregorian dates, reading lines, and push copy in
   engine Section 11.6.1. Four implementation rules in engine Section 12.3.
   No ephemeris needed. Multi-day Khoiak period (Oct 22 – Nov 19) uses a
   standing layer constant, not individual table entries.

6. SOTHIS ANNUAL READING
   What it is: Egyptian New Year reading generated on July 23 every year.
   Replaces the daily reading. Looks forward across the year ahead. 300-400
   words. The only app in the world that celebrates the Egyptian New Year.
   How to build: Triggered by date check (July 23). Reading structure in
   engine Section 11.3. Uses natal data + current year's dominant transit.
   Store as the user's "year reading" accessible from their profile for
   12 months.

7. EGYPTIAN SKY MAP (visual birth chart)
   What it is: A circular birth chart rendered in Egyptian visual language.
   Not a Western zodiac wheel. Visual elements: Nut arching over the top,
   the Nile running along the base, the 36 decan band as an outer ring, planets
   shown as their Egyptian deity glyphs. Every placement is tappable — tapping
   opens the corresponding deity or decan entry from the Temple Library.
   How to build: Custom SVG/Canvas render. Positions from Swiss Ephemeris
   natal data. Egyptian deity glyphs require a dedicated visual design pass
   before engineering. Each tappable region links to Temple Library entries.
   This is design-heavy — coordinate with visual design before starting.

8. DECAN & HOUSE EXPLORER
   What it is: Tappable overlays on the sky map. Each of the 36 decans opens
   its full profile: presiding deity (character-first intro), divine force,
   core decree, shadow. The 12 houses show their Egyptian names and domains.
   How to build: Static content — decan entries from engine Section 5, house
   entries from engine Section 6. Rendered as tappable overlay on the sky map.
   No AI generation needed. Pre-written content surfaced on demand.

9. THE KA READING (compatibility)
   What it is: A reading generated from two natal charts describing the
   dynamic between two people through Egyptian mythology. Three types:
   Romantic Ka, Friendship Ka, Challenge Ka. No compatibility score — a
   reading about a living dynamic. Output includes a shareable card.
   How to build: Two natal profiles → identify each user's Ascendant decan
   deity → look up the deity pairing → pass both natal profiles + pairing
   identity to engine with KA reading type instruction → engine generates
   the Ka Reading (150-200 words). Shareable output card generated as a
   formatted image. Ka deity pairing logic needs a companion reference table
   (build alongside this feature — map each deity-to-deity combination to
   its mythological dynamic).

10. THE CIRCLE OF KA (friends list)
    What it is: Friends list reframed as the Circle of Ka. Each friend's
    profile shows their active decan force today alongside the user's, with
    a one-sentence reading about what the day's energy means for the
    connection. Standard social graph: friend request / accept.
    How to build: Friend profiles show name + Ascendant decan + today's
    active force. One-sentence connection reading generated daily per friend
    pair from a lightweight prompt (not a full engine call). Non-user friend
    profiles visible via invitation link — shows partial natal display to
    drive downloads.

11. THE ORACLE CHAMBER (question feature)
    What it is: The user types a question or situation (max 200 characters).
    The engine generates a single oracular response — 150-200 words, full
    four-register structure, priestly voice. One response per session. No
    follow-up capability in v1. Premium feature with limited free uses per
    month.
    How to build: Pass question text + natal data + current transit state +
    hemerological charge to engine with ORACLE reading type instruction.
    Engine generates a single response. No conversation loop. The single-
    response constraint is intentional and must not be circumvented.

12. TEMPLE LIBRARY — DEITY GLOSSARY
    What it is: Tappable from the sky map. Each deity has a full portrait
    entry written in the app's voice — not a definition, a character. Covers:
    the deity's living quality, their mythological story in brief, what they
    govern in a chart, real-world themes. Organized by: Planetary Forces,
    The Decans (36 entries), Calendar Deities.
    How to build: Static content. All entries pre-written from engine
    Sections 3 and 5, expanded to portrait length. Search enabled. No AI
    generation. Tappable from sky map placements.

13. TEMPLE LIBRARY — SACRED CALENDAR
    What it is: The hemerological calendar made visible and explorable.
    Each of the 17 charged dates has a full entry: what the day is, its
    mythological source, what it means, how to navigate it. Calendar view
    shows the full year with charged days marked. Upcoming charged days
    surfaced on the home screen beneath the daily reading.
    How to build: Static content from engine Section 11.6.1. Calendar view
    with charged dates marked. Tapping a date opens its full entry.

14. SHAREABLE READING CARDS
    What it is: Each reading generates a shareable card for Instagram/TikTok
    stories. Shows: the active deity's name and character, the hemerological
    charge if active, one sentence from the reading's practical call. Egyptian
    visual identity — hieroglyphic border, deity symbol, sand/gold palette.
    How to build: On-device card generation from reading output. The engine
    output includes a designated "shareable sentence" (the practical call or
    witnessing close). Card template is a fixed design — no user customization
    in v1. Export as image.

15. PARTIAL PROFILE FOR NON-USERS (invitation flow)
    What it is: When a user runs a Ka Reading with a non-user, the non-user
    receives an invitation link. The link shows them a partial version of
    their natal reading — enough to feel the quality of the product. CTA:
    "See your full decree."
    How to build: Invitation link generated with a birth data hash
    (privacy-safe). Landing page renders a partial natal reading via the
    engine using the non-user's birth data. Tracks conversion from Ka Reading
    invitations. This is the primary organic acquisition funnel.


==============================================================================
V1.5 — First major update, ~60-90 days post-launch
==============================================================================

16. HISTORICAL FIGURES DATABASE
    What it is: A curated database of historical figures users can run Ka
    Readings against. Phase 1: 20-30 Egyptian historical figures (pharaohs,
    queens, notable priests) with pre-calculated natal positions. Phase 2:
    broader world history figures with verified birth data. Running a Ka
    Reading against Cleopatra or Ramesses II is a uniquely shareable format.
    How to build: Static database of pre-calculated natal fields for each
    figure. Ka Readings against historical figures use the same engine as
    user-to-user Ka Readings. Figures filterable by era, role, deity
    affiliation. Historical figures with no verified birth time use solar
    chart (Sun as Ascendant) with clear labeling.

17. THE NILE RECORD (retrospective time travel)
    What it is: User enters significant life dates with a brief label ("when
    I got married," "when I was laid off"). The engine generates a 120-150
    word retrospective reading for each date showing what was cosmologically
    active at that moment and naming which divine force was operating in
    which domain of life.
    How to build: User inputs date + label. System calculates transits active
    on that historical date using Swiss Ephemeris historical positions. Engine
    generates a retrospective reading (NILE_RECORD reading type). Store
    user's significant dates in profile. Premium feature.

18. THE COMING SEASONS (forward timing, 90-day view)
    What it is: A 90-day forward view showing which divine forces are active
    when and what domains of life they are moving through. Visual timeline
    showing active retrogrades, eclipse windows, significant transits to natal
    positions, and hemerological charged days. Tapping any point opens a brief
    reading about that period.
    How to build: Pre-calculate 90 days of transit states for the user's natal
    chart. Render as a scrollable visual timeline. Tapping a point passes that
    date's transit state + natal data to engine for a brief (80-100 word)
    reading. Premium feature.

19. COSMIC CLIMATE (monthly editorial content)
    What it is: Monthly editorial pieces covering what divine forces are most
    active this season, what the Egyptian calendar says is happening, and
    practical guidance for navigating the period. Written in the app's full
    voice. Surfaced in the Temple Library as "current season." Push
    notification on publication. Shareable as a formatted card.
    How to build: Human-written content with AI-assisted drafting, editorial
    review before publication. Not AI-generated and auto-published — requires
    a content operations workflow. Stored as static content in the Temple
    Library with a "current" flag on the active piece.


==============================================================================
V2 — Second release cycle
==============================================================================

20. AUDIO READINGS
    What it is: The existing natal reading and daily readings spoken aloud.
    Not new content — the existing text rendered as audio. Voice direction:
    present and certain, not warm-and-encouraging (therapy voice) or
    mysterious-and-whispery (generic astrology voice). The scribe who has
    looked at something real and is reporting it.
    How to build: Phase 1 (V2 launch): professional voice actor records the
    natal reading. All daily readings use high-quality TTS. Phase 2: daily
    readings recorded or TTS with ambient sound design. Phase 3: original
    ambient compositions per deity and season. The text is already written
    for audio — paragraph breaks are breath pauses, sentence lengths work
    spoken aloud.


==============================================================================
V3 — Long-horizon features requiring user density or infrastructure
==============================================================================

21. CONNECT (Ka-based dating)
    What it is: Ka-based matching rather than compatibility score matching.
    Users shown potential matches whose decan forces create specific
    mythological dynamics with their own. In-app messaging. Dating as
    mythology.
    How to build: Requires opt-in. Match pool filtered by Ka pairing quality.
    Leverage Ka Reading engine for initial compatibility display. In-app
    messaging layer.
    IMPORTANT: Do not build before the user base reaches meaningful density
    in target cities. An empty dating feature creates a negative experience
    and damages retention. This is a V3 feature because it requires scale,
    not because it is technically complex.

22. BABYLONIAN / MESOPOTAMIAN ASTROLOGY SYSTEM
    What it is: The second astrology system added to the app. Babylonian is
    the correct first addition after Egyptian because: it shares the decan
    framework, it is the civilization that invented natal astrology and
    contributed the zodiac to Egyptian astrology, and it has a compelling
    press narrative ("the system that started it all").
    How to build: Requires building a full second engine file equivalent to
    the Egyptian engine, covering: Babylonian deity mappings for planets,
    the omen tradition as the interpretive frame, MUL.APIN star catalog as
    the decan equivalent, and the Enuma Anu Enlil as the transit tradition.
    The reading generation architecture (Section 12 of the Egyptian engine)
    is reusable — only the content layer needs rebuilding.
    Do not begin until the Egyptian system has demonstrated retention and
    the content architecture is proven at scale.


==============================================================================
FEATURES WITH NO COMPETITOR EQUIVALENT
==============================================================================

These three Launch features have no meaningful equivalent in Co-Star or
The Pattern. They are the product's most defensible differentiators.

THE HEMEROLOGICAL CALENDAR
17 charged dates per year drawn from real Egyptian papyrological sources
(Cairo Calendar, Edfu inscriptions, Plutarch's De Iside et Osiride). A
daily content layer independent of user birth charts. Generates consistent
social and press moments throughout the year. No other app in the world
has this.

THE SOTHIS ANNUAL READING
A genuine Egyptian New Year reading on July 23, replacing the daily reading
and framing the year ahead. A recurring press event. "The only app that
celebrates the Egyptian New Year" is a story that writes itself every July.

THE ORACLE CHAMBER (constrained single-response form)
Not because no competitor has a question feature — but because the single
oracular response in this specific voice, grounded in this specific mythology,
forces a quality that open-ended conversation cannot sustain. The constraint
is the product. Egyptian oracles gave single pronouncements. The limitation
is mythologically appropriate and must be maintained.


==============================================================================
END OF FEATURE PLAN
